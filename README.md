# ResearchWriter

> This is a mini project created to learn about Agentic agent.

---

## Overview

**ResearchWriter** is a learning-focused project designed to experiment with Agentic agent architectures—software entities capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, and action. This repository is primarily developed in Python and uses Streamlit for user interaction and demonstration.

---

## Features

- **Agentic Agent Framework**: Modular design for agent logic.
- **Streamlit UI**: Interactive web interface using Streamlit.
- **Extensible Python Codebase**: Well-organized files for agents, tasks, and utilities.
- **Learning-Oriented**: Documentation and structure ideal for students or researchers.
